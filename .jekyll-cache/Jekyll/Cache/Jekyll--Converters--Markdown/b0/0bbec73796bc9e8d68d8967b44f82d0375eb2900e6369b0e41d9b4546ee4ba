<h3 id="what">What?</h3>

<p>An adventure of a lifetime to the remote Yamal Peninsula in Siberia, Russia. For 9 days we will live the life of the indigenous Nenet people, follow their daily rhythm, and document their century-old customs. While doing so, I will teach you all I know about visual story-telling &amp; portrait photography. A unique opportunity to learn more about this beautiful culture and to expand your knowledge about photography.¬†</p>

<h3 id="where-and-who">Where and who?</h3>

<p>Yamal Peninsula, Siberia. Yamal in the language of the indigenous Nenets means the end of the world; it is a remote, windblasted place of permafrost, serpentine rivers and dwarf shrubs, and has been home to the reindeer herding Nenets people for over a thousand years. The Nenets people of the Siberian arctic are the guardians of a style of reindeer herding that is the last of its kind. Through a yearly migration of over a thousand kilometers, these people move gigantic herds of reindeer from summer pastures in the north to winter pastures just south of the Arctic Circle. No-one knows for certain whether it is the reindeer that lead the people or vice versa. With temperatures often plummeting below -50¬∞C and fierce winds these Arctic nomads live in one of the world‚Äôs most challenging environments. A strong work ethic and a robust and vibrant culture is what unites these reindeer herders. One of the last in its kind.¬†</p>
