<p>The story of Albert Odar, a former poacher turned ranger in Murchison Falls National Park, Uganda. A story about hope, courage and fear.Â </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> On April 23, 2020, my dear friend Albert Odar, one of Africaâ€™s finest and most dedicated rangers, had died in a vehicle incident in Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda. He leaves a wife and 8 kids behind, the youngest only 4 years old. His family is now in immediate need of support, and you can help!</p>

<p>We lost a true hero from the tough and often dangerous world of front line conservation. An incredible human being. An example for many.Â </p>

<p>RIP my friend.Â </p>
