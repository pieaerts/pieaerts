I"f<p>1 day, 3 different locations, sometimes weddings can be hectic. But love is what stitches all those little pieces together. Especially with these two! So much enthusiasm, dancing, eating &amp; laughing. Thanks Bart &amp; Christine for allowing me to be part of it. I had an amazing time. This story is for you!Â </p>
