##### Oftentimes, when travelling, it’s not the grand scale or epic nature that grabs me most, but rather the small details that would normally go overlooked. Real connection with people. Human emotion. Because in a world that’s so guarded and fearful, nothing is more beautiful than people that are willing to show their soul. To show the simple, imperfect but mysterious nature of being human.&nbsp;

##### And there’s something very strange and touching about that. Something I can’t get enough of.
