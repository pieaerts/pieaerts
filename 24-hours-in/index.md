Oftentimes, when travelling, it’s not the grand scale or epic nature that grabs me most, but rather the small details that would normally go overlooked. Real connection with people. Human emotion. Because in a world that’s so guarded and fearful, nothing is more beautiful than people that are willing to show their true soul.&nbsp;<br>These series are a tribute to that, a tribute to humankind.&nbsp;

Brief visits. Quick in. Quick out. Sometimes 12, sometimes 48, but most of the times 24 hours. Just to show you the simple, imperfect but mysterious nature of being human.<br>Because there’s something very strange and touching about that. Something I can’t get enough of.
