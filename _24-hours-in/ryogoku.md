Given their physique, it might seem obvious to assume that sumo wrestlers are couch potatoes. However, nothing is further from the truth. Their lives are as harshly regimented as those of prison inmates which a daily scheme of torturous hours of smashing their bodies against each other and constant hardcore strength training.<br>After all, this lifestyle isn’t a one-way ticket to fame and fortune since there is only little profit to be had. Many wrestlers don’t even begin earning a salary until they make it into the upper ranks of the league. Until that moment, they train, and train, and train and essentially act as servants for more superior members of the stable. Just another reminder of devotion, focus and dedication that makes these Japanese athletes stand out in such a powerful way.

ver had a hard time putting up with your little 6-week diet? Read this.<br>Been spending some significant time in a sumo stable during our stay in Japan witnessing the impressive daily routine of its wrestlers.<br>They wake at dawn, as early as 5am to get trained a full 3 hours without having breakfast on the assumption that this slows down the metabolism and makes it more difficult to burn calories.<br>Around lunchtime, the wrestlers sit down to a protein-rich stew of meat, vegetables, and rice along with a dozen of side dishes. This daily feast can be quite an ordeal, as the men eat to the point of nausea and beyond.&nbsp;<br>This massive repast is followed by a nice long nap, where the calories are allowed to take root to maximize weight gain.<br>Around dinnertime, the giants awaken from their slumber to participate in yet another massive meal before retiring for the night. Once again nauseousness wins.&nbsp;<br>Picture yourself doing this for 40 years, every single day, with a fair chance to never ever win an official match.<br>Now think about your diet again.
