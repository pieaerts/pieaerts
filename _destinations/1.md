Gjogv, named after its 200-meter long sea-filled gorge and surrounded by sheer cliffs and rough ocean, is definitely one the most recognizable villages in the Atlantic.

Once a lively town of 283, nowadays houses 26 people. Historically the village has been hit hard by boat and shipping accidents making people increasingly realize to start an academic learning and leave the town.

There was a time when the village was home to 33 children who had all lost their fathers on sea. Besides that it’s a mere 20 minutes to the nearest grocery store, by car.
