From the oldest desert in the world where dunes are mountains, to the ancient bushman skills of the San people. And from the dried-out salt pans of Deadvlei to walking with the Big-5 in Erindi. It truly is a journey back in time.&nbsp;

Thanks to [Erindi](https://erindi.com)[&nbsp;Namibia](__notset__)&nbsp;for being a home away from home and for doing some amazing conservational work. And a big shout-out to [&Beyond Travel](https://www.andbeyond.com) and in particular [&Beyond Sossusvlei](https://www.andbeyond.com/our-lodges/africa/namibia/sossusvlei-desert/andbeyond-sossusvlei-desert-lodge/) for showing us what ‘real’ African hospitality is all about and for getting every single detail right.&nbsp;
