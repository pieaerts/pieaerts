### Why?

Because I love sharing my passion for story-telling with people\! And because over the past few years, I've learned that growing and developing your talents mainly happens in close contact with other creatives. You simply need a teachable spirit in order to keep growing. So let's get ready and fine-tune your story-telling skills to be ready when the world opens up again\!&nbsp;

### What?

A full day of inspiration in the realm of visual story-telling focusing on the main question: what does it mean to be a story-teller in 2021?&nbsp; I will teach you all I know about the emotional power of story-telling, the technical aspects of photography, the digital and analogue gear I use and the ins & outs of post production. On top I will help you in understanding how to build a successful brand as a photographer and how to make your work stand-out in this social media age. We will have dinner together and afterwards hit the streets where I will help you building confidence in predicting unfolding scenes and approaching strangers. Eventually we regroup to evaluate each others work and have some drinks.&nbsp;

### Where?

### The photographer

Pie Aerts is a Dutch documentary photographer with a sincere interest in human/wildlife conflict stories. Through his lens, he examines the intricate relationship between animals, humans and nature. And, as we become increasingly distant from the natural world, each other and ourselves, he uses photography to search for the cause of this disconnect in an attempt to understand the mysterious and imperfect nature of being human. The photographs of Aerts unleash an engaging sense of connection and invite us to reflect on the essence of our existence. Pie is official Canon Europe Ambassador and founder of ‘Prints for Wildlife’, a month-long fundraiser that collected 660.000 dollars for conservation areas badly affected by COVID-19. He is a firm believer that art can be an incredibly powerful tool in restoring that lost and damaged connection he investigates.

### Testimonials&nbsp;

***Daniel (South Africa)*** - I consider Pie’s masterclass as some of the best money I have ever spent. What I loved was that Pie wasn’t there to teach the technical elements of photography (although he very generously shared some fantastic tips) but more he spoke about connection. How he uses photography to connect to the world, to himself and to his purpose in life. Which was incredibly refreshing. I found that because of Pie’s ability to speak about what photography was to him it opened space for the rest of us to do the same. This wasn’t as much a photography masterclass as much as it was a masterclass on photography as a way of truly living life. If you’re a person that finds that being behind your lens is a gateway to connecting to and representing the world then this is the masterclass for you.&nbsp;

***Laurine (Netherlands)*** - My hearts desire was to find a course where passion, quality and authenticity would dance together. Pie totally nailed that. I could not have asked for more. Jess was just the cherry on the cake with her heartfelt hospitality and nourishing food. Give yourself this gift and boost towards your next level as a conscious photographer.&nbsp;

***Deepa (Philippines)*** - Pie's class really made me think about choices I make: How i see the world, what I spend time and energy creating, who I do it for, and most importantly, why?

***Sander (Netherlands) -***&nbsp;It was very nice to finally meet Pie in person after years of following his work. This masterclass was not just about photography. It was about the relation between a story and a photo. If you follow Pie's work, you can tell he can capture these two things simultaneously in one beautiful shot. Pie shares his vision, his wisdom, his true opinion and most of all his joy. At the end of the day I left Amsterdam with a smile from ear to ear and I fell in love with photography even more than before.

***Colette (Netherlands)*** - I was really excited when I saw that Pie hosted a masterclass\! I didn’t really know what to expect, But I was blown away by the amazing insights he offered into real story-telling. His passion & creativity are beautiful to witness. Can’t wait for the next one.
