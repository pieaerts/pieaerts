After successfully selling out the first edition of this unique photography expedition in January 2022 in the blink of an eye, we are back with a second edition, this time in January 2023. Together with Talisman Travel Design and Great Plains Conservation, we're offering the exact same itinerary as last year! We will visit Great Plains Ol Donyo Lodge in the incredible Chyulu Hills and Great Plains Mara Nyika Camp in Naboisho Conservancy. In the past few years, I have visited both areas multiple times, which results in a very elaborate understanding of the wildlife, the guides, the seasonality, the light and the photographic opportunities. For a period of 9 nights, we will emerge ourselves in some of Africa’s wildest flora and fauna and stay in top-notch Great Plains properties.

### Day-to-day itinerary

With everybody traveling towards Kenya from different directions, the first day is all about landing and acclimatising. We are kicking off the trip in Nairobi National Park, just outside of the city, and only a 40 minute drive from the International Airport and are spending the first night in The Emakoko Lodge, a family-run boutique lodge that will give you a wonderful introduction to Kenya. The next morning we board an early flight to Chyulu Hills.

_Day 2 – 6_

Early in the morning we travel to Wilson Airport where we will board our flight to Chyulu Hills Airstrip. We have booked an additional freight chair on all domestic flights which means every participant can carry an additional 10kg of luggage in addition to the 15kg that’s allowed. After a short 45 minutes flight we touch down on a dusty airstrip on the edge of the might Chyulu mountain range, with Kilimanjaro welcoming us in the background. Our guides at Ol Donyo will be waiting for us at the airstrip and the first game drive is a fact.

In the heart of the lush Chyulu Hills, in between Tsavo East and Amboseli National Park, you will find Ol Donyo Lodge, our home for the next 4 nights. The lodge is small and intimate and with only seven suites, exclusivity is guaranteed. For this trip we have therefore booked this lodge exclusively for our group, no other tourist will be around. On top of that, Ol Donyo is the only lodge with access to the 275.000 hectares Mbirikani Group Ranch, which means it will be just us and the animals, no other vehicles. The next 4 days we will spend in the field, exploring all aspects of this mind-blowing landscape. Since it's predominantly known for its big Supertusker elephants, this will be our main focus. Especially this time of the year, they will frequently come to the waterhole right in front of the lodge. A sunken photography hide on the edge of the waterhole will give us prime access to experiencing some of the biggest elephants on the planet from only a few foot away. But there's more, we will also explore the diverse landscapes of the Chyulu region, spend time with the resident prides of lions, we will climb hills to enjoy sunset views over Kilimanjaro, embark on exhilarating walking safaris or night drives, venture into the mountains and have the possibility to go horseback riding with giraffes, elephants and cheetahs. In between all activities, there's the option to relax at your own private plunge pool that comes with every suite, do some editing in your room, or attend one of my lectures around lunch-time about several photography related topics. Anything is possible, for 5 days the Chyulu Hills are our playground.

On day 6 after our morning game drive we will transfer to the airstrip and board our flight to Wilson Airport. We switch planes on the runway in Nairobi and connect straight through to Mara Naboisho Airstrip. 

_Day 6 – 10_

After spending 5 days in the Chyulu Hills we shift our focus to Big Cats! Because you just arrived in one of the Masai Mara's most abundant conservancies, Naboisho Conservancy. It’s one of the most densely populated wildlife conservancies in all of Kenya and therefore literally dotted with wildlife, everywhere you look. Another big added benefit of this area is the feeling of exclusivity and intimacy due to the limited number of visitors allowed. Once again, it will be mostly us and the animals. We spend 4 nights in Mara Nyika Camp, run by Great Plains. We will spend full mornings and afternoons in the field and only get back to camp for lunch and a short rest. I will show you some of my most favorite secret spots and we will spend time with some of the most impressive leopards, cheetahs and lions of the Mara.

On the morning of the 10th day, we will check out to make our way back to Wilson Airport in Nairobi. Upon return everybody will proceed his/her own travels.

### **Chyulu Hills & the Mbirikani Group Ranch**

The philosophy of Great Plains Conservation is all about conserving nature and culture. And the Mbirikani Group Ranch is a perfect example of what happens if people come together. The lodge we visit lies in a 275.000 hectare area that belongs to the local Maasai. 

Due to a unique cooperation, they benefit directly from the profit of the lodge and ensure the conservation of the ranch and wildlife. This resulted in an area rich of wildlife, even with some of Africa's 'great tuskers' roaming freely. Centuries ago, a safari was a journey for pioneers with the focus on adventure and exploration. Even though the essence of safari is still that, more and more travelers are looking for experiences that bring a deeper connection, an immersive experience in nature that has a positive impact on both human, wildlife and nature. Ol Donyo offers, besides gamedrives and hosted bushwalks, a lot of other activities. Mountainbiking, learning more about nature and culture preservation, supporting the anti-poaching units, horseriding and yoga-classes are some examples of activities you can enjoy at the lodge.

No suite is the same, but all are highly comfortable and have their own plunge pool. The decor is inspired by the surrounding landscapes and is a mix of modern and colonial. Very special is the rooftop terrace on every suite, where you will find a starbed. Enjoy a night under the African sky, with only the stars to cover you.

The family suite with two bedrooms is perfectly suited for families with children.

Amboseli National Park covers 392 sq kms, only a small portion of the surrounding 3000 sq km of the Amboseli ecosystem. Our camp, Tortilis Camp, is located on the south western edge of the park, facing the mount Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa. It overlooks its own private wildlife conservancy, Kitirua Conservancy which is 30,000 acres in size. Away from the busy eastern side of Amboseli, and with its own private conservancy, you will experience a truly remarkable little corner of Africa.

The area is famous for the dramatic views of Kilimanjaro, the highest free-standing mountain in the world. But even more so, for its healthy elephant populations, which have been followed and documented by world renowned researcher Cynthia Moss. Amboseli is derived from the local Maa word ‘Empusel’ which means ‘dusty place’, and it is one of the top places in the entire world to see elephants in the wild. Within this ecosystem reside some of the largest elephants in Africa, and the guides we work with at Tortilis Camp know the individual elephants by name and family history. An incredible way to learn more about elephant conservation.

We are staying at Tortilis Camp, a camp that is particularly known for its unique location, being the only lodge/camp with access to the Kitirua Conservancy where all the magic happens. More than 50% of the guides at Tortilis are Maasai, with strong ties to the surrounding communities. All tents are simple but spacious, with king or twin beds, depending on the composition of the group. Each tent has an ensuite bathroom. The entire lodge has a thatched roof and great nostalgic feel. The main area has a huge deck overlooking Kilimanjaro. The lodge runs on 100% solar energy and was one of the first eco lodges of its size.We are staying at Tortilis Camp, a camp that is particularly known for its unique location, being the only lodge/camp with access to the Kitirua Conservancy where all the magic happens.

Even though our focus of the first leg of the trip is on elephants, it is very likely that we will bump into lions, cheetah, hyena’s, zebra, giraffe, hippo’s, lots and lots of birdlife and maybe even a leopard. It is a true photographers paradise!

The days are warm, rising to a maximum of 30 degrees centigrade, but very comfortable with minimum humidity. October is very dry, which creates lots of dust, making for incredible imagery. The mornings and evenings are cool so bring some warm clothes.

### **Mara North Conservancy**

Mara Nyika Camp, meaning “Large Plains or Great Plains,” is an intimate tented camp set in a valley and. a perfect location for your safari in Kenya. The camp tucked away under the treetop canopy straddles a small stream on the western side of the Naboisho Conservancy bordering the Maasai Mara.

Mara Nyika Camp and its light-coloured canvas suites are designed to sit under the canopy of umbrella thorn trees. All the suites offer guests unforgettable views out over the plains. Walkways from the guest suites to the main area evoke the feeling of a treehouse under canvas. The camp’s ethics and inspiration are one of exploration and adventure. Privacy is the key to Mara Nyika Camp. Privacy to live, think, explore, be romantic and be pampered – all the while with one of the most spectacular backdrops Africa can provide.

The lush rolling hills of Mara North will be a welcome break from the dry & dusty Amboseli. These vast, fertile plains boast a plethora of wildlife; with over 450 bird species and both resident and transient populations of lion, leopard, buffalo, giraffe, zebra, cheetah and elephant. On top, Elephant Pepper Camp is perfect for those wanting to observe the spectacle of the migration, classified amoung the “Seven Wonders of the World”, when, from July to November, over 1.3 million wildebeest and zebra cross from the Serengeti in search of greener pastures. The camps remote location allows for all animals to walk through camp day and night, which means it is perfectly common to have lion, leopards and hyena foraging around your tent. Temperatures are a bit lower than in Amboseli, which means mornings can be very chilly, all depending on the emergence of the short rains, that usually in November.

All tents are set underneath Fig and Elephant Pepper trees and are spaced out to ensure privacy. From your personal verandah or hammock, you can watch wildlife roam the Mara North plains. Tents are spacious and luxurious and offer spacious ensuite bathroom areas.

We are very flexible when it comes to planning our days. Usually, we leave each day with a packed breakfast, which allows us to stay out in the field all morning. If the conditions and sightings are good, we can even decide having lunch in the field to maximize our time with wildlife. We also carry our own sundowner drinks each afternoon, which gives us full flexibility.

As you can see in the planning, at lunch time I will host several lectures. Topics can be workflow, post-production, animal behavior, composition, light, elephant conservation, and so on. In between activities there’s also room for 1-on-1 tuition about any of the above topics.

### **Which kind of vehicles will we use?**

In both lodges we will use Toyota Land Cruisers that are specially modified for photography. On board you will find bean bags, blankets, a fridge with ice-cold drinks and 220volt electricity sockets for charging. There will be a maximum 4 people sitting in the back, creating enough space for everyone to move around. I will be sitting in the front, next to the driver and alternate between both vehicles. A rotating scheme will make sure everyone gets to spend an equal amount of time in my direct presence. Working with the right people is everything. Therefore, I carefully selected the best possible naturalists/guides that will lead us on this expedition. As a result, we will work with some of the best people in the industry.

### **Do I need any photography experience?**

Nope, not at all. Everybody is welcome. Beginners and professionals. In fact, a diverse group always makes up for a lot of fun, because the main idea of these expeditions is all about interaction and learning from each other. I’m more than happy to explain you the basics of how to use your camera, but we can also have a deeper conversation about how to grow your personal brand as a visual artist, or how to find your voice. So please don’t hesitate if you have never used a camera before, I’m there to help.

### **What type of gear do I need?**

As soon as you have confirmed your booking, we will share an extensive list of recommended gear items that you would need for this expedition. However, don’t stress, any camera will work, it all depends on how you use it. We offer a custom advise for every level, from amateurs and beginners to full professional photographers.

### **How is this photography expedition different from any regular safari?**

In the past 2 years I have spent 45+ weeks in Kenya and I know the country and its people inside out. This has generated an in-detail understanding of seasonality, geography, animal behavior, photographic opportunities, community living, and conservation. This combined with 10+ years of experience in photographic story-telling, makes this trip a unique opportunity to learn. The entire itinerary is crafted based on photographic opportunity, which means I deliberated chose certain areas camps and guides to work with. We will maximize time in the field and won’t be restricted by gate opening hours. We have off-road access and full flexibility everywhere we go. In between game drives – I will be hosting lectures and there’s room for 1-on-1 tuition as well. It’s a trip that’s centered around teaching you how to tell meaningful stories about the wild and you will go home with an incredible series of images!

### **Can I cancel my seat when I change my mind?**

For more information about Terms & Conditions click [here](https://www.pieaerts.com/terms/).

### **Is there an option to book a private room?**

Yes, there is. However, the aforementioned price is based on twin sharing, which means you will share the room with another person in the group. As soon as the group is complete, we will make a roomplan taking into account personal preferences. The single supplement of $ 1750 will give you a private room in both lodges.

### **Will you advise what documents to organize in order to travel?**

Of course. We will send you a full briefing before the trip on which steps you need to take in order to travel according to local and international Covid laws. Please be aware that Kenya, in addition to a negative PCR result, also requires a double vaccination in order to enter the country. This might change overtime and we will keep you posted accordingly.

### **Optional: Hot air balloon safaris**

During both legs of the trip, it is possible to embark on a once-of-a-lifetime hot air balloon safari. You can decide on flying over Amboseli National Park and look at big herds of elephants from above, or explore the Masai Mara from the air. Both landscapes are very different, the former being very dry and flat, the latter being lush and hilly. This activity comes at an extra cost and is excluded in the rate of this trip. However, I do have very good contacts with hot air balloon operators in both areas.

### The host

Pie Aerts (@pie_aerts) is a Dutch documentary and wildlife photographer with a sincere interest in human/wildlife conflict stories. Through his lens, he examines the intricate relationship between animals, humans and nature and, as we become increasingly distant from each other and ourselves, he uses photography to search for the cause of this disconnect. He believes art can be an incredibly powerful tool in restoring that lost connection and therefore founded Prints for Wildlife in march 2020. Since the international outbreak of COVID-19 Pie spend more than 45 weeks in Kenya, visualising his personal relationship with the Kenyan landscape. Pie serves as a Canon EMEA ambassador and as Hahnemühle Natural Line Ambassador.
