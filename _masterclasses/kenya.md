# Let's go to Africa!

![](/uploads/img_5134.JPG)

I am collaborating with my dear partner Elewana Collection, who run sixteen boutique lodges in locations across Kenya and Tanzania. On this particular trip, we will visit 2 of their most iconic camps, Tortilis Camp in Amboseli and Elephant Pepper Camp in Mara North. In the past few years, I have visited both conservancies multiple times, which results in a very elaborate understanding of the area as well the wildlife, the guides, the seasonality and the light. I also took some of my best wildlife images in both places, so you better get ready for a wild ride. For a period of 9 nights, we will emerge ourselves in both conservancies and experience some of Africa’s wildest flora and fauna. The first half is spent in Amboseli, focusing on elephants, whereas the second half of the trip is spent in the Masai Mara, focusing on Big Cats.

### Day-to-day itinerary

_Day 1_

With everybody traveling towards Kenya from different directions, the first day is all about landing and acclimatizing. We are spending the first night at Hemingways, a luxury five-star hotel in Nairobi. The next morning our adventure starts!

_Day 2 – 6_

Early in the morning we travel to Wilson Airport where we will board our flight to Amboseli National Park Airstrip. We have booked an additional freight chair on all domestic flights which means every participant can carry an additional 10kg of luggage in addition to the 15kg that’s allowed. After a short 45 minutes flight we arrive in Amboseli and transfer to our lodge right on the edge of Kitirua Conservancy.

We will stay at this amazing camp for 4 nights and will spend full days in the field. This particular camp is the only camp in Amboseli that has access to the dried Amboseli lake-bed. If you have followed some of my previous trips to this area, you know that October is the best month of the year to visit this place. It’s the end of the dry season and the lake has completely dried up, creating one of the most impressive photography backdrops in the world. Flat as a coin, with mount Kilimanjaro in the background. Herds of elephants up to 60-80 or even more individuals cross the lake-bed twice a day on their way from the forest to the swamps and back, in search of food and water. On top of it all, the arrival of rains in November will give us beautiful cloud build-up in the afternoon, which is incredible for dramatic and moody photography of these gentle giants. Due to the camp’s exclusive access to this area, there won’t be any other vehicles around. It will be just us and the elephants. We have organized off-road permits which means that we are free to move around anywhere we want, on the Conservancy side as well as the National Park side, which will lead to unique photographic opportunities.

_Day 6_

On day 6 after our morning game drive we will transfer to the airstrip and board our flight to Wilson Airport. We switch planes on the runway in Nairobi and connect straight through to Mara North Airstrip.

### The photographer

In the past few years, Dutch photographer Pie Aerts has traveled to some of the most remote corners of our planet. From the deep jungles of West Papua to the high plains of Bolivia and from the tiniest Himalayan mountain villages to the beating heart of the Okavango Delta, always on a quest to connect with people through photography and to capture the unfiltered reality of everyday life.
