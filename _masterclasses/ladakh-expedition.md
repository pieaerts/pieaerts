For more than a decade Pie has been traveling to India. After more than 20 individual assignments on the Indian subcontinent, he made his first appearance in Ladakh in September 2022, and instantly fell in love.

In the months that followed he carefully crafted an incredibly unique itinerary that crosses the entire region, focusing on meaningful and genuine interactions with the Ladakhi people, learning about their lifestyle, culture and traditions.

Under the guidance of Pie you will travel through this unique trans himalayan region for a period of 10 days, visiting Buddhist monasteries, nomadic tribes, countryside villages and some of the most mind blowing landscapes you will encounter in your life.

Soon, we will be able to release the full in-depth itinerary as well as the dates & prices, but all we can say now is, get ready for a once-in-a-lifetime photographic expedition!

Pie Aerts is a Dutch documentary and wildlife photographer with a sincere interest in human/wildlife coexistence stories. Through his lens, he examines the intricate relationship between animals, humans and nature and, as we become increasingly distant from each other and ourselves, he uses photography to search for the cause of this disconnect. Heâ€™s the founder of Prints for Wildlife, a fundraising platform that since its inception in 2020 has generated 2.1mio dollars for conservation and believes art can be an incredibly powerful tool to restore the disconnect. Pie also serves as Canon EMEA Ambassador, Gitzo Ambassador and Hahnemuhle Ambassador.
