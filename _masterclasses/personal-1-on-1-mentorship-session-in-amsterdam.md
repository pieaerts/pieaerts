### What?

A 2 hour session between you and me in my studio in Amsterdam. We will chat about anything you like. About finding your voice as an artist, creating stories from scratch to publication, building your name on social media, gear, post-production, publishing books, printing your work and much more. See it as a personal version of my visual story-telling masterclass. There’s room for as much open questions as you want, critique of your portfolio and advice about future steps in building your personal brand. Do you want any advise on how to further build your creative career, this session will show you the way.

### Why?

Because I absolutely love sharing my passion for photographic story-telling with people! And because over the past few years, I've learned that growing and developing your talents mainly happens in close contact with other creatives. You simply need a teachable spirit in order to keep growing. So let's get ready and fine-tune your story-telling skills to be ready when the world opens up again!

### Price?

The price of a virtual mentorship session is EUR 300,- for a 2 hour session. As soon as your time slot is approved, you will be send a payment link. Prices are excluding VAT.

### Who?

Pie Aerts is a Dutch documentary and wildlife photographer with a sincere interest in human/wildlife coexistence stories. Through his lens, he examines the intricate relationship between animals, humans and nature and, as we become increasingly distant from each other and ourselves, he uses photography to search for the cause of this disconnect. He’s the founder of Prints for Wildlife, a fundraising platform that since its inception in 2020 has generated 2.1mio dollars for conservation and believes art can be an incredibly powerful tool to restore the disconnect. Pie also serves as Canon EMEA Ambassador, Gitzo Ambassador and Hahnemuhle Ambassador.
