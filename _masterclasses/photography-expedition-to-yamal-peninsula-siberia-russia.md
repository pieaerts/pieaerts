### What?

An adventure of a lifetime to the remote Yamal Peninsula in Siberia, Russia. For 9 days we will live the life of the indigenous Nenet people, follow their daily rhythm, and document their century-old customs. While doing so, I will teach you all I know about visual story-telling and portrait photography. A unique opportunity to learn more about this beautiful culture and to expand your knowledge about photography.&nbsp;

### Where and who?

Yamal Peninsula, Siberia. With temperatures often plummeting below -50&deg;C and fierce winds these Arctic nomads live in one of the world's most challenging environments. A strong work ethic and a robust and vibrant culture is what unites these reindeer herders. One of the last in its kind.&nbsp;

### Price?

The price of the workshop is € 4200,- per person . There is room for 4-8 participants. Trip starts and ends in Moscow.&nbsp;

**Day 3-7 / 10rd-11th-12th-13th -14th March:** Live with the nomads, eating and sleeping in their chums (reindeer fur teepees). There will be no fixed itinerary for these days. Guests will merely observe and take part in the daily lives, hunting for the Northern lights. Daily life could include herding reindeer (up to 700 in one herd), lassoing reindeer with reindeer rawhide lassoes. Cutting trees for firewood, collecting ice or snow for water, help with making new sleds, cleaning reindeer skins (fur), sewing fur clothing and such. We can also do short hikes by the snowshoes in the Polar Ural mountains. Try ice fishing and hunting depends on the time of year, location(s) and weather conditions. (L,B,D)

**Day 8 – 15th March:** After a shared breakfast with the family we will go by snowmobile to the Kharp village, where we will be picked up by car(s) and transport to Salekhard. Accommodate in the hotel, personal time. Overnight in hotel, double room. (B)

**Day 9 – 16th March:** Free day in Salekhard in case of bad weather delaying our return. On this day we can visit the museum, visit the 16th century fortress of Obdursk, the first Russian settlement built on this site, visit the market square where nomads sell meat, fish and furs.

Another option goes to ice fishing. We can go to the special place on the Sob river. We will drive over 40 km to the South from Salekhard along a “zimnik”. Zimniks are temporary winter roads which do not exist in summer. They are built of compacted snow, or on the surface of frozen rivers. And over than 20 km without any roads, only destination. You will know the Siberian tricks for catching white fish, taste the fish soup with will cook right on the field. (L,D)

After return from the fishing we'll go to the Russian banya (sauna).

### The photographer

In the past few years, Dutch photographer Pie Aerts has traveled to some of the most remote corners of our planet. From the deep jungles of West Papua to the high plains of Bolivia and from the tiniest Himalayan mountain villages to the beating heart of the Okavango Delta, always on a quest to connect with people through photography and to capture the unfiltered reality of everyday life.&nbsp;
