### What?

A 1,5 hour session between you and me. I will video-call you and we will chat about anything you like. About finding your voice as an artist, creating stories from scratch to publication, building your name on social media, gear, post-production, publishing books, printing your work and much more. There’s room for as much open questions as you want, critique of your portfolio and advice about future steps in building your personal brand. You are in control of this 1 hour session and I'm there to help you!

### Why?

Because I absolutely love sharing my passion for story-telling with people! And because over the past few years, I've learned that growing and developing your talents mainly happens in close contact with other creatives. You simply need a teachable spirit in order to keep growing. But also because there's so many people not able to travel to Amsterdam to attend my masterclasses. So let's get ready and make use of this lock-down to fine-tune your storytelling skills to be ready when the world opens up again!

### Price?

The price of a virtual mentorship session is EUR 300,- for a 1,5 hour session. As soon as your time slot is approved, you will be send a payment link. Prices are excluding VAT.

### Who?

Pie Aerts is a Dutch documentary photographer with a sincere interest in human/wildlife conflict stories. Through his lens, he examines the intricate relationship between animals, humans and nature. And, as we become increasingly distant from the natural world, each other and ourselves, he uses photography to search for the cause of this disconnect in an attempt to understand the mysterious and imperfect nature of being human. His photography unleashes an engaging sense of connection and invite us to reflect on the essence of our existence. Pie is official Canon Europe Ambassador and founder of ‘Prints for Wildlife’, a month-long fundraiser that collected 1.75mio dollars for conservation areas badly affected by COVID-19. He is a firm believer that art can be an incredibly powerful tool in restoring that lost and damaged connection he investigates.
