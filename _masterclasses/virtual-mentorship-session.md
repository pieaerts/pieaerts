### Why?

Because I freaking love sharing my passion for story-telling with people\! And because over the past few years, I've learned that growing and developing your talents mainly happens in close contact with other creatives. You simply need a teachable spirit in order to keep growing. But also because there's so many people not able to travel to Amsterdam to attend my masterclasses. So let's get ready and fine-tune your story-telling skills to be ready when the world opens up again\!&nbsp;

### What?

A 1+ hour session between you and me. I will video-call you and we will chat about anything you like, business strategy, social media, gear, about how to find your own voice. There’s room for as much open questions as you want, critique of your portfolio and advice about future steps in building your personal brand. You are in control of this 1 hour session and I'm there to help you\!&nbsp;

### Price?

The price of a virtual mentorship session is EUR 250,- for a 1+ hour session. As soon as your time slot is approved, you will be send a payment link.&nbsp;

### The photographer

After studying at the Hogere Hotelschool Maastricht and an eventful corporate career at Ahold Delhaize, Pie Aerts decided to change course. He says goodbye to his comfortable life in the Netherlands and ventures into the world. In all but everyday locations in more than twenty countries, Aerts explores what it means to be "human", with an emphasis on the simple, imperfect and mysterious of our daily existence. He spends weeks with gauchos in Patagonia, chases poachers in Uganda, lives with Buddhist monks in monasteries high in the Himalayas and travels deep into the heart of Papua. The photographs of Aerts, a self-taught talent unique at this time, unleash an engaging sense of connection and invite us to reflect on the essence of our existence. Through his lens, he not only examines the relationship between humans, animals and nature, but also tries to find an answer to the question of how it may be that we seem to become increasingly distant from each other and from ourselves.
