Zambia truly is one of the last remaining unspoiled safari destinations. A place that many people described as Africa of 10-15 years ago. A journey back in time almost, to the nostalgic essentials of a true African safari. During this trip we will explore the bush with vehicles, on boats, in canoes and on foot. A combination of means of transport that only exists in a handful of African destinations.

For this expedition, I am collaborating with Chiawa Safaris, an award-winning collection of Safari Camps. Last year, in 2021, I ventured on a 14-day long trip with them to South Luangwa and Lower Zambezi and I was so mind-blown that I decided to repeat that very same trip, but this time offering the opportunity for 6 people to join me and to share this incredible experience that is Zambia.
