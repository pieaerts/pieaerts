Zambia truly is one of the last remaining unspoiled safari destinations. A place that many people describe as Africa of 10-15 years ago. For this expedition, I am collaborating with Chiawa Safaris, an award-winning collection of Safari Camps.

Last year, in 2021, I ventured on a 18-day long trip with them to South Luangwa and Lower Zambezi and I was so mind-blown that I decided to repeat that very same itinerary, but this time offering the opportunity for 6 people to join me and to share this incredible experience that is Zambia.

During this trip we will explore the bush not only with vehicles but even more so on boats, in canoes and on foot. Because Zambia is particularly known for walking safaris - one of the most incredible and honest interactions you can have with wild animals - this is an expedition like no other.

On this trip we will visit 3 of their 4 camps. We kick-off with Lower Zambezi National Park and visit Old Mondoro as well as the iconic Chiawa Camp. After that we transfer to South Luangwa National Park where we will stay at Puku Ridge Lodge. We will stay in each camp for 3 nights, working with some of the best guides in the industry since Chiawa has been awarded ‘best guiding team in Africa’ multiple times. For a period of 10 nights, we will emerge ourselves in one of the most unique ecosystems in the world and experience some of Africa’s wildest flora and fauna. And all of that, in the best possible season, the end of the dry season, which makes for spectacular game viewing.

### Day-to-day itinerary

The expedition starts on August 28, 2023 in Lusaka. With everyone traveling towards Zambia from different directions, the first day is all about landing and acclimatising. We are spending the first night at Protea Towers, a Marriott hotel in the capital city Lusaka. The next morning our adventure starts!

Day 2 – 5

Early in the morning of August 29 we travel to the domestic Airport where we will board out flight to Lower Zambezi National Park. After a short flight of only 35 minutes, we will be picked up from Jeki Airstrip by vehicle transfer and make our way to the first camp, Old Mondoro.

Old Mondoro has been hands down the most intimate bush experience I had in all my years in Africa. It’s a small camp consisting of only 5 chalets and the concept is simple - to provide guests with an authentic and unedited Zambian safari, providing a “back to the bush” atmosphere that centralizes on the wildlife and wilderness experience. We will be completely disconnected from the internet for the next 3 nights and experience some of the most incredible wildlife encounters on the planet. Wild animals are part of the camp and part of our daily routine.

Elephants are literally residing inside the camp, under the canopy of winterthorn trees on the banks of the Zambezi River. Big cat sightings (some of the most prolific leopard sightings to be had in Africa) are very common as well, with the magic of the water providing island-hopping buffalo and elephants at your doorstep, as well as an extreme concentration of hippo. “Mondoro” in Goba language means Lion. The camp name honours a mythical white lion that used to prowl nearby – although “Old Mondoro” is long gone, his descendants still roam the wilderness of the Lower Zambezi, wild and free.

The 5 chalets are constructed of reed and canvas, each with a beautiful and comfortable shaded deck that overlooks the Zambezi River. Each room has an en-suite bathroom with hot and cold water during the day as well as the night, an outdoor shower and even a bath tub that overlooks the river. The area is particularly know for walking safari’s as well as water based activity and of course we will experience both, under the guidance of some of Africa’s best guides.

The reason I picked September to be our month, is because it’s the end of the dry season. It will be hot which means animals come to drink at the last remaining waterholes and concentrate around the river. It’s the best month of the year to visit Lower Zambezi, and given the fact that our camp is situated right at the Zambezi banks, the animals will literally be everywhere you look.

_Day 5 – 8_

On the morning of Day 5 we get picked up at Old Mondoro by boat and transfer via water to our second camp, called Chiawa Camp. After staying in a ground-level bush camp for 3 nights, we now switch to Chiawa Safari’s flagship luxury camp. An award-wininig camp that combines the best of two worlds; first-class service and top-notch luxury accommodation as well as some of the most exceptional game viewing in the world.

The camp is consisting of 9 spacious and luxurious tents and each tent is equipped with an ensuite bathroom. All tents are covered by big thatched roofs which ensures for cool mid-days in the blazing Zambian heat. A wonderful place to relax in between game drives and activities.

During our stay at Chiawa Camp we will experience a totally different side of Lower Zambezi National Park then Old Mondoro. Even though both camps are only 1,5 hours apart, the vegetation is completely different which makes again for unique photographic opportunities. During long days in the bush and on the water, we will come across lions, leopards, wild dogs and large elephant herds, but also spend up and close time with buffalo’s, hippo’s, antelope, crocodiles, serval, an amazing array of birds and many more amazing species.

During sunrise the low light pours across the floodplains, igniting the tops of the winterthorn glades where elephants are feeding on fallen seedpods (better known as elephant cookies). The area around our camp is the perfect hunting ground for lions, leopards and wild dogs; but above all this timeless valley is a land of giants, of towering, ancient trees and the elephant herds that find sanctuary beneath their dappled shade.

Day 8 – 11

On the morning of Day 9 we get transferred by boat and later by car to Jeki Airstrip again, where we will board our flight to South Luangwa National Park, our second destination of the trip. It will be tough leaving this magical place behind but in front of us lies another top-notch Zambian safari destination.

After arrival we will be picked up from the airstrip and transferred to Puku Ridge, a newly renovated lodge in the middle of South Luangwa National Park, build on a ridge and overlooking a private waterhole and private floodplain.

The South Luangwa is 9,050 square kilometres and is colloquially referred to as the “Valley of the Leopard” due to such a high density of this elusive African animal being found in the park. Both day and night sightings are waiting for you! While modest in size, the South Luangwa is still largely uninhabited and unexplored, providing guests with a remote and private feel. The area is arguably home to Africa’s best bush walks exploring the valley on foot and even with the likely possibility of encountering some very rare African wild dogs.

For 3 nights we will explore this exciting ecosystem. In many ways it is very different from Lower Zambezi, but both areas have 1 thing in common, wildlife is abundant. Each of the 8 luxury safari tents are set on an elevated ridge overlooking woodlands and plains full of wildlife. Every room has a multi-level veranda with a plunge pool plus a towering star bed for nights under the vast African sky.

Day 11

On the morning of Day 11, on September 7, we will board our plane back to Lusaka and the trip comes to an end. We will arrive in Lusaka around mid-day so you can connect on your flight home that same night.

We are very flexible when it comes to planning our days. Usually, we leave each day with a packed breakfast, which allows us to stay out in the field all morning. If the conditions and sightings are good, we can even decide having lunch in the field to maximize our time with wildlife. We also carry our own sundowner drinks each afternoon, which gives us full flexibility.

As you can see in the planning, at lunch time I will host several lectures. Topics can be workflow, post-production, animal behaviour, composition, light, elephant conservation, how to find your voice as an artist, social media, equipment, and so on. In between activities there’s also room for 1-on-1 tuition about any of the above topics or whatever comes to mind.

### Which kind of vehicles will we use?

In both lodges we will use Toyota Land Cruisers that are specially modified for photography. On board you will find bean bags, blankets, a fridge with ice-cold drinks and 220 volt electricity sockets for charging. There will be a maximum of 3 people sitting in the back giving each participant enough space to move around. I will be sitting in the front, next to the driver and alternate between both vehicles. A rotating scheme will make sure everyone gets to spend an equal amount of time in my direct presence. Working with the right people is everything. Therefore, I carefully selected the best possible naturalists/guides that will lead us on this expedition. As a result, we will work with some of the best people in the industry, award-winning guiding teams in all 3 camps.

### Do I need any photography experience?

Nope, not at all. Everybody is welcome. Beginners and professionals. In fact, a diverse group always makes up for a lot of fun, because the main idea of these expeditions is all about interaction and learning from each other. I’m more than happy to explain you the basics of how to use your camera, but we can also have a deeper conversation about how to grow your personal brand as a visual artist, or how to find your voice. So please don’t hesitate if you have never used a camera before, I’m there to help.

### What type of gear do I need?

As soon as you have confirmed your booking, we will share an extensive list of recommended gear items that you would need for this expedition. However, don’t stress, any camera will work, it all depends on how you use it. We offer a custom advise for every level, from amateurs and beginners to full professional photographers.

### How is this photography expedition different from any regular safari?

In the past 3 years I have spent more than 45 weeks in Africa spread across Kenya, Zambia and Botswana. This has generated an in-detail understanding of seasonality, geography, animal behavior, photographic opportunities, community living and cultural aspects, and of course wildlife conservation. This combined with 10+ years of experience in photographic story-telling, makes this trip a unique opportunity to learn. The entire itinerary is crafted around the theme of story-telling, which means I deliberately chose certain areas, camps and guides to work with. We will maximise time in the field and won’t be restricted by gate opening hours. We work with an award-winning guiding team in all 3 camps on this trip. I will be hosting lectures and there’s room for 1-on-1 tuition as well. It’s a trip that’s centered around teaching you how to tell meaningful stories about the wild and you will go home with an incredible series of images!

### Can I cancel my seat when I change my mind?

### Will you advise what documents to organize in order to travel?

Of course. We will send you a full briefing before the trip on which steps you need to take in order to travel according to local and international Covid laws. Please be aware that many African countries, in addition to a negative PCR result, also requires a double vaccination in order to enter the country.

### The host

Pie Aerts (@pie_aerts) is a Dutch documentary and wildlife photographer with a sincere interest in human/wildlife conflict stories. Through his lens, he examines the intricate relationship between animals, humans and nature and, as we become increasingly distant from each other and ourselves, he uses photography to search for the cause of this disconnect. He believes art can be an incredibly powerful tool in restoring that lost connection and therefore founded Prints for Wildlife in march 2020. Since the international outbreak of COVID-19 Pie spend more than 45 weeks in Africa, visualising his personal relationship with the African landscape. Pie serves as a Canon EMEA ambassador and as a Hahnemühle Ambassador.
