A country that only recently opened up to the world. A place with ongoing ethnic conflict and a complex work in progress. But the latest developments have given its people renewed belief in the future, igniting compassion and hope. These are a few of the moments I saw through my lens.&nbsp;

Thanks to [Visit Myanmar](http://myanmar.travel){: target="_blank"} for inviting us over and for showing us all corners of this amazing country.
