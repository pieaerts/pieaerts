April 25, 2015. A day that will forever be a black page in the history of Nepal. A devastating earthquake killed thousands and left entire regions homeless. Exactly 3 years later we touched base but instead of being welcomed by destruction and grief we found some of the warmest smiles we ever encountered. From the lower Terai wetlands till the highest Himalayan peaks and from the city buzz of Kathmandu till the smallest countryside villages. We found people that never lost hope.

Big shout out to [Budget Trekking Nepal](https://budgettrekking.com){: target="_blank"} for guiding us in discovering every corner of this amazing country. They truly employ some of most warm-hearted people we ever came across.
