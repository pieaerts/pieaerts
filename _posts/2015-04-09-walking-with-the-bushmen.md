### Growing up in the West, understanding the strong connection between humans, animals and nature isn't one of the first things one learns. Spending a few weeks in the African bush made me realise that’s a very big shame. Let me tell you why.

After seeing it appear in BBC documentaries for over a decade, it was finally time to touch ground in what seems to be one of the biggest inland freshwater delta’s of our planet. One big mysterious maze of papyrus reeds, water channels full of lilies and swamps dotted with crocs, hippos, elephants and lions. The Okavango Delta.&nbsp;<br>The scale and magnificence of these slushy swamplands are unreal. Vast wetlands full of life as far as the eye can see, the annual flow of water, the daily drama of its wildlife and the untouched wilderness in its purest form. There's something so elemental to this place.

Unlike the large, commercialised parks in Kenya and Tanzania, most Botswana game reserves only allow a certain amount of vehicles per day in each park. And that's how we found ourselves spending the entire trip completely alone in the Botswana wilderness. Just us and the bush. No other cars. No other people. <br>While many African countries chase the "big five" (lions, elephants, cape buffalo, leopards, and rhinoceros) by tracking radio-collared animals, the Okavango region of Botswana does things differently. Trackers are well-trained and intuitive and have spent years perfecting their craft. We had the privilege of experiencing these innate skills with which these trackers chase their animals thanks to the epic bushman skills of our guide Kane, the personification of Bushkarma. A man that feels, smells and reads the bush. Where other guides just follow the freshest tracks. It feels like animals find him instead of the other way around.

It's absolutely nuts to tell by the tracks of an animal its sex, age, speed, physical condition, time of passing and even whether it's hungry, angry or lonely. "All activities happening in the bush tell you a certain story my friend. Whether it's the behaviour of birds, the funny smell of carcasses, the directions of the wind, the conditions of vegetation and the tracks of any other animal around. Talk to the bush, and the bush talks back”, where some of his first words.

While sitting in his wooden ‘Mokoro’ being pushed forward by Kefentse, one of the local villagers he used to hunt with when they where young boys, only a few hours of conversation where enough to realise the strong connection these people are having with their surroundings. After seeing it from the air and from the water, it was time to set foot in Big-5-territory in the way it has been done for hundreds of thousands of years, by foot… <br>A walking safari in these conditions puts you in mental state of being I haven't experienced before. A prehistoric state of alertness. Tracking signs, smells and footprints of wild predators and analysing your environment step by step forces you to loose control, connect to nature and let the bush do the rest, resulting in eye-to-eye stare downs like this one. Somehow, I guess the secret is 'letting go'. The more you adapt to the situation, the more you start feeling at ease. It's about patience. It's about trust. And it makes you realise some things happen just because they happen, without you having an impact on it. I belief the best way to deal with this is to accept that sometimes trust has to take over fear.

And then there’s the nights. It feels like the entire bush escapes from the sun and the heat of the day, when the night falls. All predators appear and everyone and everything becomes alert. You smell and hear more because you see less. The moment the sun drops below the horizon, all sound disappears and for 1 single moment the entire bush becomes quiet. In just under 30 minutes Paradise becomes Prehistory. Day becomes night.<br>&nbsp;I’ll never forget the sound of roaring lions next to our tent. It has been one of the scariest things I've experienced in a very long time. It's like being called from the Ice Age. Even 2km away, it resonates in your bones, vibrations that make you shiver.

After spending some time disconnecting from our busy speedy lives back home and reorganising our systems to the rhythm of the bush, it became pretty clear that the true essence of life is not what the Western world makes you belief it is. Experiencing this raw connection with nature first-hand, puts things back in perspective, there were they belong. The vulnerability, the immense power of instinct, the strong presence of purpose and the joy of the little things. All happening in a world where everything seems bigger than yourself. Africa you did it. Again. <br>Call me a hippie but all ever said about this place is true. You can shake the sand from your shoes, but not from your soul.
