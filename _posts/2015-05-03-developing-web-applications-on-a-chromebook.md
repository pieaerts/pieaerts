I have bought a Chromebook 2 from Toshiba. Very nice machine. I have set up git on Cloud9 to develop web applications without leaving my browser. So far so good, but there are some steps required in the progress to make it go smoothly.

First, you set up your account (in my case with the URL from BitBicket). Then, after you log in you start MySQL, by typing mysql-ctl start. To start php, type service apache2 start. And to edit the database, use these credentials for adminer:

host: 127.0.0.1
<br>username: username
<br>password: no password
<br>database name: c9

Happy coding!
