### Sensory overload, color clash, sound cacophony. Right in your face, in any possible way you could think of. Filthy, crowded, poor, corrupt, illiterate, chaotic, strange and full of gender inequality on the one side, but wealthy, educated, welcoming, cultured, peaceful, happy and well-organised on the other. But besides all that, more than any other country, India feels timeless too. For some reason every single place feels so connected to its most distant past. Whether its the sari’s the people still wear, the ancient cuisine they still adore, the many beautiful dialects that still exist or the gods they pray to at roadside shrines or in impressive temples. And while walking from Kolkata to Kerala with a camera in one hand and your Western point of view in the other, you quickly realise there’s no other place where predictions of disastrous collapse and global supremacy must be treated with such equal seriousness. Welcome to India.

No other country encapsulates diversity so perfectly as India. The simplicity and quietness of rural life is striking and unpretentious compared to the intense city buzz in metropolitan cities like Delhi and Bombay. In fact, there’s only 3 rules that need to be obeyed. Rule nr 1. There is always something magic and unexpected around every single corner. Rule nr. 2. Anything can happen. Rule nr 3. There is nowhere like it. Not a single day ends the way you planned it in the morning.

After touching down in Calcutta, one of the most polluted cities in the world, we made our way into Varanasi, the spiritual capital of India and one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. Located right at the Ganges we went head first into the heart of India. &nbsp; I’ll never forget my first encounter with one of the holy Brahmans at the river banks, welcoming us with the wise words: “Welcome to a place where the human past is still alive my son”. It was time to embrace our inner beastie boy and start cruising down the small alleys of the Holy city.
