When thinking about the Philippines all that comes to mind is probably beaches, coconuts, palm trees, whale sharks and a few terrible headliners about the devastating impact of earthquakes and typhoons. On top of that, when telling friends and family I was heading there, nearly all of them straightaway strongly recommended me to avoid the capital of Manila, Asia's stinky armpit. For that reason, and for the love of Asian urban chaos and city slums, I couldn't resist staying longer than usual in order to see if I could proof the opposite. The findings were remarkable. Let me tell you why in 9 photos.&nbsp;

It's known for being the poorest and most underdeveloped area of the country, houses most of Manila’s slums and has always been the gritty end of town. Being one of the most densely populated pieces of land in the world with more than 73.000 people per square km, it’s a human pressure cooker compared to London housing 5.177 inhabitants per square km.
