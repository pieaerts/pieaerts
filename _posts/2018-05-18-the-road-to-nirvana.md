Being a 13 year-old kid, I could totally lose myself in the story-telling capabilities of my history teacher. No one could tell stories like he did and as a result I often dreamt for days about the ancient Greek, the discoveries of Christopher Columbus or the Spanish civil war. He seemed to know everything about those times and when I carefully closed my eyes in the back of the room, it felt as if I was there. With him. With them. Unfortunately, it’s not often that you get to meet such people. People that inspire. People that move you. But when you do, you better make use of it and that’s the reason why I’d like to share Karin’s story with you. Because meeting her last month during our time in Kathmandu, Nepal, made me relive those golden days in High School all over again. Let me tell you why.

With Buddhist philosophy slowly making its way into the West, we decided to give it a try and signed up for an 11-day course called “Discovering Tibetan Buddhism” in Kopan Monastery, situated on a hill 30 minutes outside of Kathmandu. Amongst 150 like-minded people from all ages, all colours and all walks of life, we emerged ourselves in an extensive program to learn more about Buddhist philosophy and the power of our mind.&nbsp;

Spending time in a Buddhist monastery, far away from the buzz of our cities, the noise of our streets and the speed of our lives, can be a very healing thing. Life in there is not dictated by the minutes, but by the rhythm of the cosmos and whereas speed mostly is the key indicator for life in the Western world, these shelters have turned slowness into a virtue. There’s no clocks, no alarm calls, no time. Rather, the days are guided by the setting and the rising of the sun, the morning puja and the serving of the soup.

Aside from daily meditations, we spend the first 8 days of the course learning about compassion, kindness and the power of our mind. We joined daily teaching by the monks about anger, affection, ignorance and faith. We sat down in discussion groups talking about things like karma, ethics, reincarnation and enlightenment. We had lots of occasional walks in the monastery gardens thinking about our universal existence and we contemplated with monks and nuns of all ages and backgrounds about how ‘they’ perceive reality. After those 8 days, we engaged in a 2-day silent retreat. No talking. No eye-contact. Just noble silence. A welcoming space to think and to slowly digest all new methods of generating happiness.&nbsp;

Our course leader for the entire 11 days surprisingly turned out to be a Swedish nun, Karin Valham. After traveling through Southeast Asia in the 1970s she stumbled upon an exquisite image of Shakyamuni Buddha in a photo shop near Freak Street, the well know hippie-haunt for travellers in Kathmandu. As a result she took a chance on a meditation course on the very same Kopan Hill, 30 minutes outside of the city. It turned out to be the ‘most wonderful experience’ of her life and she would become a nun just one year later. This is her story.&nbsp;

It was 1973 and being a daughter from Swedish protestants, I was on the way to becoming a social worker, just like everyone was at that time. I was serving as a nurse in a local hospital just outside of Stockholm and the amount of misery and suffering I encountered on a daily basis was unheard of. However, in some way I felt so extremely limited to help all those poor people. It felt as if there was something missing inside of me. So I decided to take a break to travel and to create space to think and hopefully return with more energy. I went to Asia. After making my way around Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, I ended up in a cave among the hippies on Lamaro Beach in Darwin, Australia. It was mid seventies and everyone was happy. However, some money that my parents send over from Europe got stuck in a bank in India so I had to go back to Sweden to sort things out. My final destination on the way back home would be Nepal, a well trodden path back in that day.&nbsp;

After arriving in Kathmandu by bus from India, a local rickshaw driver took us to a little hostel right next to the large stupa in Thahity Chowk. The only room available was dirty with no shower but I kept it because of the stupa view. From the very beginning of my journey in Sri Lanka I always enjoyed the presence of Buddha images. The way they smile at everyone struck me, I guess.&nbsp;
