### One of the questions I get asked the most (apart from the obvious gear talk) is what ‘photography tips’ I have for people. Therefore I thought it would be nice to list a few. Hereby my personal top 10 for improving your outdoor & wildlife photography skills. At a later stage I’ll also run one for travel & portrait work.&nbsp;

## Stop taking about gear

My number 1 advise for becoming a better photographer: Stop talking about gear. And start taking photos. No matter which camera you own, the truth is that sharper lenses and more megapixels don’t necessarily enhance your ability to tell a story or compose an image. Real improvement only exists through practice and learning from failure. Not through purchase.

## Explore your home

Many people think good photography requires travel. They’re wrong. You better visit that one interesting place close to home a hundred times instead of visiting a hundred different places further away from home only once. In doing so you’ll end up finding the conditions you’ve been dreaming about. Patience & persistence are key for distinct image making. Trust me, in the end, you don't have to go somewhere new for wonder, just look at that same old spot with new eyes. Try it. I’m sure you’ll be surprised.&nbsp;

## Get up earlier

Even if you think you got up early enough, get up earlier! Don’t be one of the people that sleep through the good things. The hour before the sun rises is the most magical hour of the day with often every minute a different lightning situation. Plus the ‘sunset crowds’ are still in a deep sleep which gives you more space to do your own thing.
