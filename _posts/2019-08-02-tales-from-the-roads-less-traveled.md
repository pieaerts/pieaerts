It’s a powerful feeling, to put something out in the world and see what happens. It’s scary, exciting and dizzying all at the same time. It can crash and burn. Or it can take off and fly. Never before in my life I have worked so hard for something. Never before I have put so much love, feeling, dedication and time in 1 project.&nbsp;

But all of this has made it, hands down, the most thoughtful, awake, inspiring and encouraging period of my life. And if there is one thing it has taught me, it’s to trust your instinct, because belief it or not, oftentimes when creating the stories for this book, I didn’t have a single clue what I was doing, I just followed my heart. And I think that’s what art is all about, trusting your gut and believing that the dots will all somehow connect in the future.
