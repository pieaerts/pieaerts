### Why?

Over the past few years, I've learned that growing and developing your talents mainly happens in close contact with other creatives. Because being an artist, you need a teachable spirit in order to keep growing. Therefore I couldn’t be more stoked to share my love & passion for image-making with you\!

### What?

A full day of inspiration in the realm of travel & street photography focusing on the main question: what does it mean to be a story-teller in 2019? We will start the day with an interactive session in which I will teach you all I know about the emotional power of story-telling, the technical aspects of photography and the ins & outs of post production. We will have dinner together and afterwards hit the streets where I will help you building confidence in predicting unfolding scenes and approaching strangers. Eventually we regroup to evaluate each others work.&nbsp;

### Where?

Bloom Room, Derde Helmersstraat 30H, Amsterdam. This creative space is located only 5 minutes away from Leidse Square, right in the middle of the city.

\`Check it out here: [https://www.bloomroom.nl&nbsp;](https://www.bloomroom.nl){: target="_blank"}

The program for the day is as following:

13\.30 - 14.00 Walk-in

14\.00 - 15.30 Ins & outs of story-telling

15\.30 - 16.30 Technical aspects & editing&nbsp;

16\.30 - 17.30 Early dinner

17\.30 - 20.00 Shooting on the streets of Amsterdam

20\.00 - 21.00 Evaluation of images while having drinks

The reason why we start at 14.00 and finish late, is because we want to hit the streets with beautiful soft lightning conditions.&nbsp;

### Who?

This masterclass offers space for 15 participants. You don’t need any professional experience but it helps if you know your way around your own camera. If not, don’t worry, I’m there to help you\!&nbsp;

I will be hosting the full day program. My girlfriend Jessica will be serving a beautiful vegetarian meal. If you have any allergies or dietary restrictions, please let me know.&nbsp;

### The photographer

In the past few years, Dutch photographer Pie Aerts has traveled to some of the most remote corners of our planet. From the deep jungles of West Papua to the high plains of Bolivia and from the tiniest Himalayan mountain villages to the beating heart of the Okavango Delta, always on a quest to connect with people through photography and to capture the unfiltered reality of everyday life.&nbsp;

### Testimonials&nbsp;

***Daniel (South Africa)*** - I consider Pie’s masterclass as some of the best money I have ever spent. What I loved was that Pie wasn’t there to teach the technical elements of photography (although he very generously shared some fantastic tips) but more he spoke about connection. How he uses photography to connect to the world, to himself and to his purpose in life. Which was incredibly refreshing. I found that because of Pie’s ability to speak about what photography was to him it opened space for the rest of us to do the same. This wasn’t as much a photography masterclass as much as it was a masterclass on photography as a way of truly living life. If you’re a person that finds that being behind your lens is a gateway to connecting to and representing the world then this is the masterclass for you.&nbsp;

***Sander (Netherlands) -***&nbsp;It was very nice to finally meet Pie in person after years of following his work. This masterclass was not just about photography. It was about the relation between a story and a photo. If you follow Pie's work, you can tell he can capture these two things simultaneously in one beautiful shot. Pie shares his vision, his wisdom, his true opinion and most of all his joy. At the end of the day I left Amsterdam with a smile from ear to ear and I fell in love with photography even more than before.

***Colette (Netherlands)*** - I was really excited when I saw that Pie hosted a masterclass\! I didn’t really know what to expect, But I was blown away by the amazing insights he offered into real story-telling. His passion & creativity are beautiful to witness. Can’t wait for the next one.
