### Why?

Over the past few years, I've learned that growing and developing your talents mainly happens in close contact with other creatives. On top of that, I strongly belief that being an artist, you need a teachable spirit in order to keep growing. Therefore I couldn’t be more stoked to share my love & passion for image-making with you\!

### What?

A full day of inspiration in the realm of travel & street photography focusing on the main question: what does it mean to be a story-teller in 2019? We will start with an interactive afternoon in which I will teach you all I know about the emotional power of story-telling and the technical aspects of photography. We will have dinner together and afterwards hit the streets where I will help you building confidence in predicting unfolding scenes and approaching strangers with an individual hands-on assignment. Eventually we regroup to evaluate each others work.&nbsp;

The price of the masterclass is € 175,- . As soon as your subscription is approved, you will be send a payment link.

### Where?

Bloom Room, Derde Helmersstraat 30H, Amsterdam. This creative space is located only 5 minutes away from Leidse Square, right in the middle of the city.

The program for the day is as following:

1330-1400 Walk-in

1400-1630 presentation Pie&nbsp;

1630-1730 Dinner

1730-2000 Individual assignment&nbsp;

2000-2100 Evaluation of images

### Who?

In the past few years, Dutch photographer Pie Aerts has traveled to some of the most remote corners of our planet. From the deep jungles of West Papua to the high plains of Bolivia and from the tiniest Himalayan mountain villages to the beating heart of the Okavango Delta, always on a quest to connect with people through photography and to capture the unfiltered reality of everyday life.&nbsp;

This masterclass offers space for 15 participants. You don’t need any professional experience but it helps if you know your way around your own camera. If not, don’t worry, I’m there to help you\!&nbsp;

Come join me on July 6, 2019, talking travel, life, photography and many other things\!
