### Why?

Over the past few years, I've learned that growing and developing your talents mainly happens in close contact with other creatives. Because being an artist, you need a teachable spirit in order to keep growing. Therefore I couldn’t be more stoked to share my love & passion for image-making with you\!

### What?

A full day of inspiration in the realm of travel & street photography focusing on the main question: what does it mean to be a story-teller in 2019? We will start the day with an interactive session in which I will teach you all I know about the emotional power of story-telling and the technical aspects of photography. We will have dinner together and afterwards hit the streets where I will help you building confidence in predicting unfolding scenes and approaching strangers. Eventually we regroup to evaluate each others work.&nbsp;

### Where?

Bloom Room, Derde Helmersstraat 30H, Amsterdam. This creative space is located only 5 minutes away from Leidse Square, right in the middle of the city.

The program for the day is as following:

13\.30 - 14.00 Walk-in

14\.00 - 16.30 Presentation Pie&nbsp;

16\.30 - 17.30 Dinner

17\.30 - 20.00 Individual assignment&nbsp;

20\.00 - 21.00 Evaluation of images & drinks

### Who?

This masterclass offers space for 15 participants. You don’t need any professional experience but it helps if you know your way around your own camera. If not, don’t worry, I’m there to help you\!&nbsp;

I will be hosting the full day program. My girlfriend Jessica will be serving a beautiful vegetarian meal. If you have any allergies or dietary restrictions, please let me know.&nbsp;

### The photographer

In the past few years, Dutch photographer Pie Aerts has traveled to some of the most remote corners of our planet. From the deep jungles of West Papua to the high plains of Bolivia and from the tiniest Himalayan mountain villages to the beating heart of the Okavango Delta, always on a quest to connect with people through photography and to capture the unfiltered reality of everyday life.&nbsp;
