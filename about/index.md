<div><p>My name is Pie.<br />Which has, contrary to popular belief, nothing to do with apples.<br />I love road trips, the universe, sunlight and the 70s, but above all else, telling stories.<br />Trough my viewfinder I am examining the relationship between humans, animals and the natural world in an attempt to find answers why we all seem increasingly disconnected from each other and from our natural environment.<br />A visual journey towards the essence of our existence.<br />This website is a culmination of that.&nbsp;</p></div>

You got a story to tell? Tell me first. Iâ€™d love to help.
