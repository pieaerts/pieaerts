<div>My name is Pie.</div>

<div>Contrary to popular belief this has nothing to do with apples.</div>

<div>I love road trips, the universe, sunlight and the 70s, but above all else, telling stories. &nbsp;</div>

<div>When I&rsquo;m not on the road, you most likely find me in Amsterdam, living life together with Jessica.&nbsp;</div>

<div>One of the coolest things about taking photo&rsquo;s is that it puts you in a mental state of searching for beauty.&nbsp;</div>

<div>A constant quest for pretty things.</div>

<div>In doing so, I came across lots of different people, landscapes, tales and stories.</div>

<div>This website is a culmination of that.&nbsp;</div>

<div>I hope you like it.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>PS. Did you know I shoot <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pieaerts.com/weddings">weddings</a> too?&nbsp;</div>

<div>Click <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pieaerts.com/weddings">here</a> to see some recent love stories I shot and hit me up when you like me to capture yours!</div>
