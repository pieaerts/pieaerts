<div><p>My name is Pie.<br />Which has, contrary to popular belief, nothing to do with apples.<br />Through my viewfinder I am examining the intricate relationship between humans, animals and the natural world in an attempt to find answers why we seem increasingly disconnected from each other, ourselves and from our natural environment.<br />A visual journey towards the essence of our existence.</p><p>I'm an official <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.canon-europe.com/pro/ambassadors/pie-aerts/">Canon Europe Ambassador</a>&nbsp;and proudly serve as the first global Hahnem&uuml;hle Natural Line Ambassador.&nbsp;</p><p>Because I firmly believe that art can be an incredibly powerful tool in restoring that lost connection, I initiated <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.printsforwildlife.org">Prints for Wildlife</a>, a month-long fundraiser collecting funds for African parks &amp; communities badly hit by COVID-19. Across 2 annual editions we have raised $ 1.750.000 for African Parks Network.&nbsp;</p><p>You got a story to tell? Tell me first. I&rsquo;d love to help.</p></div>
