## Reservation & Payment

The payment schedule is clearly indicated on the expedition website and varies per expedition. Payment can be made using any of the following methods:

* International bank transfer
* With a credit card through PayPal. Please note that PayPal charges banking fees for receiving funds outside of The Netherlands. These banking fees should be covered by you and will be added to the amount payable. The height of the banking fees differs per country

The banking details will be mentioned on the invoice you will receive after making the booking.

As soon as the deposit payment has been received, your seat is reserved. This deposit payment is non-refundable unless we are able to replace your seat on the expedition by someone else. In that case you will get a full refund. You will receive the final invoice 120 days in advance and full payment is due 90 days prior to departure date of your trip.

Trips are quoted in Euros or USD, depending on the currency our costs are in. All tour fees are inclusive of taxes. Payment to us can be made in Euros or USD (based on the exchange rate of the day the invoice was made).

Trips are offered based on sharing a room. A single room is often available at extra costs. In case you want to share a room but we cannot find a roommate for you, a single room will be booked for you and a single supplement will need to be charged.

## Insurance 

Cancellation must be made in writing immediately if you are prevented from traveling. If you cancel and the workshop can be filled anyway after your cancellation, we will refund you the full amount you have paid minus a 300â‚¬ service charge. If you cancel and the workshop does not fill, then you will be refunded according to the schedule found on the workshop page. Once the tour is started there shall be no refunds made. Prices are based upon group participation and no refunds shall be made on any segments of the program in which you do not wish to participate.

## Trip Cancellation and Insurance

It is advised that all travelers purchase trip cancellation and interruption insurance as protection against an emergency which may force you to cancel or leave from the tour either before it begins or while it is in progress.

## Itinerary Changes

We reserve the right to change the tour dates, itinerary, or accommodations as conditions warrant. We reserve the right to change the itinerary due to weather conditions, political conditions and other factors beyond our control without consulting the participants. It is understood that such decisions will be made in the best interests of all participants and with regards to safety first. Participants have no right to any refund or other considerations in the event of these inevitable itinerary changes. If a trip must be delayed, or the itinerary changed due to bad weather, road conditions, transportation delays, government intervention, sickness, volcanic eruption or other contingency, the cost of delays or changes is not included.

## Itinerary Cancellation

We reserve the right to cancel the tour before departure for any reason whatsoever, including too few participants or logistical problems such as strikes, wars, acts of God, volcanic eruptions, or any other circumstances which may make operation of the trip inadvisable. All trip payments received will be promptly refunded, and this refund will be the limit of our liability. We are not responsible for any expenses incurred by trip members in preparing for the trip, including nonrefundable or penalty-carrying airline tickets, special clothing, visa or passport fees or other trip related expenses.

## Limitations of Liability

We assume no responsibility whatsoever caused for injury, loss or damage to person or property in connection with any service resulting directly from: acts of God, detention, annoyance, delays, expenses arising from quarantine, strikes, thefts, pilferage, failure of any means of conveyance to arrive or depart as scheduled, civil disturbances, terrorism, government restrictions or regulations and discrepancies or changes in transit or hotel services over which it has no control. Reasonable changes in the itinerary may be made where deemed advisable for the comfort and well being of the participants. In case of a medical problem arising during the expedition, which results in costs for evacuation, use of aircraft or repatriation, the responsibility for payment of these costs belongs solely to the passenger. We strongly advise that passengers ensure that such eventualities are covered by travel insurance. If not covered by travel insurance the responsibility still remains with the passenger and I specifically decline any responsibility whatsoever.
